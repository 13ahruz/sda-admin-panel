# Git Conflict Resolution Commands

## Quick Fix for Git Pull Conflict:

```bash
# Save your local changes
git stash

# Pull the latest changes
git pull

# Apply your local changes back (optional)
git stash pop
```

## Alternative - Reset to remote version:

```bash
# This will discard your local changes and use the remote version
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull
```

## Check what changed:

```bash
# See what files have local changes
git status

# See the differences
git diff fix-400.sh
```

## Recommended approach:

Since the fix-400.sh file was likely modified locally, and we have the updated version from the repository:

```bash
# Stash local changes
git stash

# Pull updates
git pull

# Your admin panel is now updated with the latest fixes!
```

Then restart your containers:

```bash
# Use the updated fix script
chmod +x fix-400.sh
./fix-400.sh
```
